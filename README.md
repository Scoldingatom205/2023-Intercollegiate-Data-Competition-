## Business Question: How can hotels predict a TripAdvisor review, and what amenities should hotels prioritize in order to ensure the highest review?

### Dataset Structure
We were given an excel file filled with Las Vegas Hotels TripAdvisor data. Includes details about users, hotels, and reviews. The data was organized in chronological order
according to period of stay column and alphabetical order for hotels. Each hotel has 24 users where each row represents one user.

### Insights Summary
The business question wanted to address two KPI's:
  - **Number of Hotel Reviews:** Tripadvisor collects all reviews left by user. The (Nr. hotel reviews) column is the aggregate of only hotel reviews left by that user.
  - **Score:** The average score of all hotel scores the user has every given.
